# Proposal Review Process

In PyCon TW, our proposal review process is based on **Two Round** review.

Please login to PyCon TW website to review, and we **WILL NOT** reveal your identity in the whole review process.

### First Round
- Review all proposal, give rating & comments.
- Other reviewer's comments, speaker's (the author) name, and speaker's experience are masked. 
  **In other words, give votes based only on content**
- After first round, we will accept some proposals.

### Modification Stage
- Author can view the comments that reviewers anonymously left during first round.
- **Authors can modify their proposals in this stage**
- There will be no review activities during this stage.

### Second Round
- Proposals thoes were not directly accpeted from the first round will go into second round.
- Please recheck the proposals that you've reviewed in first stage, and review the proposal **again** based on the modified version.
- If you didn't update your vote and comment, or at least entering the same vote and comment, **your vote given in first round will not be taken into consideration**. (Except ones didn't change in the modification stage)
- Now you can view **the information of the author**, and **other reviewers' votes and comments (anonymous)**
- After the end of this round, acceptance of proposals will be determined. If the number of accepted proposals is insufficient or exceeding, Program Committee has the right to decide.

### Review Announcement
After review, we will email the second round votes and comments to authors. If you don't want to disclose your votes & comments, please change the "Disclose comment to proposal submitter" field to "No".

# Notice
+ Giving **constructive comments** is helpful for the review process, and helps author in the modification stage.
+ When rating, please put yourself into author's shoes, refer to [《How to Propose a Talk》](https://tw.pycon.org/2018/en-us/speaking/talk/) about good ideas and bad ideas as judging criteria. We also welcome reviewers to give us more advice on how to distinguish good and bad ideas for proposals.
+ Please vote and comment according to **Python Level** of the proposal.
For Python Level, please refer to [《How to Choose the Python Level》](https://tw.pycon.org/2018/en-us/speaking/talk/)。
+ Although accepting or rejecting is our standard as reviewers, but for PyCon TW, it's not only about accepting and rejecting, but also to foster the community. Please judge in a mindset of **how to make the proposal better**, not just yes or no.
+ Even though the review process is anonymous, we should respect author and follow PyCon TW [Code of Conduct](https://tw.pycon.org/2018/en-us/about/code-of-conduct//).

# Details
+ Language options for proposals are: English talk, Chinese talk with English slides, Chinese talk with Chinese slides and Taiwanese Hokkien. When an author choose to do **English talk**, please use English to comment.


# Voting and Acceptance mechanism
### Voting

There are four different vote options: -1, -0, +0, +1.

Each vote option's meaning is as follows:
* **-1**：Strong Reject    This **SHOULD NOT** be in PyCon TW
* **-0**：Weak Reject
* **+0**：Weak Accept
* **+1**：Strong Accept    This **SHOULD** be in PyCon TW

### Accept mechanism

When each round ends, some of the proposal will be rejected or accepted, the standard is:
* **Reject**：one or more -1s, no +0s or +1s
* **Accept**：one or more +1s, no -0s or -1s

Here are some examples:
* **Talk #1** Rejected
  -1, -0, -0, -0, -1
* **Talk #2** Do nothing, proceed to second round
  -1, -0, -0, +0
* **Talk #3** Accepted
  +1, +0, +1, +0, +0, +0, +0
* **Talk #4** Do nothing, proceed to second round
  -1, +1, -0, -0


# Q & A
**Q**: If for some reason, I may know or guess the author of a proposal. In the first round, this may cause some conflict of interest, do I qualify to review this proposal?

**A**: Briefly speaking, yes, you can review these proposals. This kind of problem is common in review processes of science journals, even if they can guess the author, they still will review those paper.  Anyways, you cannot 100% sure about the author of a proposal, there can always be a coincidence.
